### **The Challenge**

**Executive Pain Point:**
"Our procurement team is drowning in supplier management. We have over 2,000 suppliers for indirect spend, but we can't tell you what we're actually buying or if we're getting competitive pricing. Every month feels like crisis management."

**Organizational Context:**
- Decentralized procurement across facilities
- Each site maintained local supplier relationships
- No standardized taxonomy or data classification
- Limited visibility into total cost of ownership

- **78% spend concentration** with top 150 suppliers
- **$12M in spend** with suppliers having no active contracts

**Key Insights:**
- Facilities buying identical items at price variances up to 340%
- 23% of purchase orders under $500 (high administrative cost)

**Timeline to Value:**
- **Month 2:** First quick wins from duplicate elimination ($1.2M)
- **Month 4:** Major category consolidations deliver $6.8M
- **Month 6:** Full program benefits realized ($18.2M annual run-rate)

### **Client Testimonial**

*"The spend analysis revealed opportunities we never knew existed. The team transformed our chaotic supplier landscape into a strategic asset. We're not just saving money ‚Äì we're making better business decisions."*
